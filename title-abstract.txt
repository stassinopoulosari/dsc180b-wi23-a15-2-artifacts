Title:
Community Detection on Twitter

Abstract:
Recent work examined the vast unfolding of communities in large networks, in which it was shown that the Louvain Algorithm was the most effective at identifying and dividing communities into clusters. The growth of social media networks in the modern world nurtures the growth and identification of similarities between groups of people. These similarities between groups can be identified more formally as communities. While the number and types of communities grow, the identification and classification of these communities becomes more challenging. To define the scope of the project, we will be utilizing public data from the social media network Twitter. Specifically, we will look at the followers and followings of users throughout twitter. In this paper, we utilize the Louvain Algorithm to explore communities within the social media platform twitter. The results of the study allowed us to uncover and analyze distinct communities based on our seed account of a modern day rap musician named Dessa (@DessaDarling). Further research is needed to determine the potential applications of these algorithms in the field of community detection in social media since we only used one platformâ€™s data.
